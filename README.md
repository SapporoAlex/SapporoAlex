# Hi there! 👋 I'm Alex McKinley

I'm an Aussie and a passionate programmer based in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🚀

## About Me

I love programming games, as well as web development, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new things. My journey in the tech world has been learning programming skills to create as teaching materials. I love working with a team to make big ideas a reality, but I am more than capable producing good work solo.
