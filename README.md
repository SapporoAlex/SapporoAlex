# G'day mate! I'm Alex McKinley
I'm an Aussie and a passionate Pythonista based in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me
I have a background in education, and I can see the potential in utilising these skills in programming and working as a team to design and create ground-breaking programs and services. I love programming games, software development, as well as data science, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new things. I love working with a team to make big ideas a reality, but I am more than capable of also producing great work solo.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:

<h3> Games </h3>

[Defender](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Game-Defender) - Building this game taught me how to use classes and functions, in addition to creating a window to display images on. I continue to make games using these skills.

<h3> Automation </h3>

[Invoice-Creator](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Automated-Invoice) - Completing this automation project helped me understand dictionaries, openpyxl, and how to write a script that uses a gmail SMTP server.

<h3> Software Development </h3>
   
[DND Monster Attack Roller](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/DND-Monster-Attack-Roller-GUI) - This is a simple program, but because I designed it based on my specific needs, I find it extremely useful. This exemplifies how I can design a tailored program on my own.

<h3> Web Development </h3>

[PyShop](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/PyShop-Website-Made-in-Django) - This is a mock fruit shop website built with Django.

Feel free to explore and provide feedback on any of the projects!
