# G'day mate! I'm Alex McKinley
I'm an Aussie and a passionate Pythonista based in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me
I have a background in education, and I can see the potential in utilising these skills in programming and working as a team to design and create ground-breaking programs and services. I love programming games, software development, as well as data science, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new things. I love working with a team to make big ideas a reality, but I am more than capable of also producing great work solo.

<h2> Games </h2>

[Dungeon Quest](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Game-Dungeon-Quest) - This 90s inspired game has a basic enemy AI, as well a many fun gameplay feautures that show my programming ability.

[Defender](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Game-Defender) - A game with a title screen and multiple levels showing an understanding of basic animation, and python programming in general. 

[Snake](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Game-Snake) - The classic snake game with dynamic original music and sound effects.

<h2> Automation </h2>

[Japanese to English Excel Translator](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Excel-to-Deepl-Translator) - This reads the Japanese text from an excel file, stores it as text chunks in a text document, then translates the text document. Each translated text chunk is then written to the corresponding row of the original Excel file. This program uses the Openpyxl library and the Deepl API.

[Invoice-Creator](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Automated-Invoice) - Completing this automation project helped me understand dictionaries, openpyxl, and how to write a script that uses a gmail SMTP server.

<h2> Software Development </h2>

[DND Monster Attack Roller](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/DND-Monster-Attack-Roller-GUI) - This is a simple program, but because I designed it based on my specific needs, I find it extremely useful. This exemplifies how I can design a tailored program on my own.

<h2> Web Development </h2>

<img src="https://github.com/SapporoAlex/PyShop-Website-Made-in-Django/blob/main/Preview.jpg?raw=true" width="500" height="300">

[PyShop](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/PyShop-Website-Made-in-Django) - This is a mock fruit shop website built with Django.
