# Hi there! 👋 I'm Alex McKinley

I'm an Aussie and a passionate programmer based in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🚀

## About Me

I have a background in education, and I can see the potential in utilising these skills in programming and working as a team to design and create ground-breaking programs and services. I love programming games, as well as web development, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new things. I love working with a team to make big ideas a reality, but I am more than capable producing good work solo.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

I'm currently focused on mastering full-stack development. It should be a fun time!

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- Python
- Django
- HTML
- Java Script
- SQL
