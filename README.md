# G'day mate! 👋 I'm Alex McKinley
I'm an Aussie and a passionate programmer based in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🚀

## About Me
I have a background in education, and I can see the potential in utilising these skills in programming and working as a team to design and create ground-breaking programs and services. I love programming games, software development, as well as data science, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new things. I love working with a team to make big ideas a reality, but I am more than capable of also producing great work solo.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
I'm currently focused on further developing my software development and web development skills. It should be a fun time!

## 🚀 Projects
Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:

<img src="https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Game-Defender/blob/main/assets/sample.gif"
1. [Defender](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Game-Defender) - Building this game taught me how to use classes and functions, in addition to creating a window to display images on. I continue to make games using these skills.
2. [Invoice-Creator](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Automated-Invoice) - Completing this automation project helped me understand dictionaries, openpyxl, and how to write a script that uses a gmail SMTP server.
3. [DND Monster Attack Roller](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/DND-Monster-Attack-Roller-GUI) - This is a simple program, but because I designed it based on my specific needs, I find it extremely useful. This exemplifies how I can design a tailored program on my own.

Feel free to explore and provide feedback on any of the projects!
