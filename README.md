# G'day mate! I'm Alex McKinley
I'm an Aussie and a passionate Pythonista based in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me
I have a background in education, and I can see the potential in utilising these skills in programming and working as a team to design and create ground-breaking programs and services. I love programming games, software development, as well as data science, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new things. I love working with a team to make big ideas a reality, but I am more than capable of also producing great work solo.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:

<h2> Games </h2>

<img src="https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Game-Defender/blob/main/assets/sample.gif" width="300" height="300">  <img src="https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Game-Snake/blob/main/assets/sample.gif" width="300" height="300">

[Defender](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Game-Defender) - Building this game taught me how to use classes and functions, in addition to creating a window to display images on. I continue to make games using these skills.

[Snake](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Game-Snake) - The classic snake game with dynamic original music and sound effects.

<h2> Automation </h2>

[Invoice-Creator](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Automated-Invoice) - Completing this automation project helped me understand dictionaries, openpyxl, and how to write a script that uses a gmail SMTP server.

<h2> Software Development </h2>
   
[DND Monster Attack Roller](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/DND-Monster-Attack-Roller-GUI) - This is a simple program, but because I designed it based on my specific needs, I find it extremely useful. This exemplifies how I can design a tailored program on my own.

<h2> Web Development </h2>

[PyShop](https://github.com/SapporoAlex/PyShop-Website-Made-in-Django) - This is a mock fruit shop website built with Django.
